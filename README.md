## #monowheel

This is the scripts used to recreate a monowheel - this monowheel utilises a hybrid of constraints and legacy movers (only BodyGyro is used, the AlignOrientation constraint doesn't play nice with anything moving).

I've utilised wally for packages (only for the Maid package in this case), and gone for an OOP approach (this project is not big enough for a proper demonstration of OOP however)
